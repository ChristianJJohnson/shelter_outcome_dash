                According to some studies there are about 70 million stray animals in the United States alone. Solving
                 this issue can improve not only the lives of the stray animals but goes a long way in making the
                 communities they frequent better as well. One often overlooked problem that homeless animals cause is
                 the strain on ecosystems as a whole. When a non-native species overtakes an area, it can negatively
                 impact delicate ecosystems through pollution and the spreading of disease. Stray animals usually arenâ€™t 
                 vaccinated, leading to the transmission of rabies and other life-threatening diseases to other animal
                 populations. Internal parasites can also be passed along through the feces of an infected animal,
                 threatening native wildlife when the fecal matter contaminates food and water sources.

                Shelters play a huge role in meeting the problems head on by providing necessary food, water, shelter
                and standard veterinary care for animals in need. They work year round to find pets loving and sustainable
                homes. Austin, Texas is the largest No Kill community in the nation, and home to the Austin Animal Center.
                They provide shelter to more than 16,000 animals each year and animal protection and pet resource services
                to all of Austin and Travis County. As part of the City of Austin Open Data Initiative, the Austin Animal
                Center makes available its collected dataset that contains statistics and outcomes of animals entering the
                Austin Animal Services system. My data is sourced from their most recent release at the time of writing
                (March 7, 2020). While my model is strictly for educational purposes I hope it may offer some value in
                helping better understand what type of animals find homes, since as we gain understanding we can concentrate
                efforts more effectively on the animals that are the highest risk for negative outcomes such as being harder
                to find homes alongside Euthanasias and death.

                For this visual I looked at bulldogs and retriever breeds of dogs what I found was:
                total number of bulldog breeds in the dataset is 11,282 while retrievers account for 11,107 so relatively close number
                Bulldogs are more than two times more likely to be euthanized than retrievers
                Bulldogs are about 31% less likely to be adopted over retrievers
